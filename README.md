# Sample-Web-Page
This is a simple webpage created by me to show my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for professional purposes. 
Currently still a work-in-progress, will update as I go.
I am using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to complete this. 
HTML: I used my html knowledge to create a navbar, and skeleton of the page, and shaped it to my preferences. 
CSS: I used my CSS knowledge and references from MDN to complete the styling aspects of the webpage. 
JavaScript: I used my knowledge of JavaScript and references from MDN to help add in JavaScript Functions and Elements to my webpage. Allowing pop-up menus, email registration, and more to make the site more modern and manageable.
